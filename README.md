# TTT Agent

This is an implementation of a multiagent value iteration algorithm for playing Tic Tac Toe.

## Primer

The problem can be formulated into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which we assess elements such as 
environment, state, action, and value. The implementation leverages a dynamic programming algorithm called
[value iteration](https://web.mit.edu/dimitrib/www/Multiagent_VI.pdf) to find the optimal action for any
state in the tic-tac-toe environment.
